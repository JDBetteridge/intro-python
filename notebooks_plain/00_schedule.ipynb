    "The best way to learn how to program is to do something useful, so this introduction to Python is built around a common scientific task: data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our real goal isn’t to just to teach Python, but to teach you the basic concepts that all programming depends on. We use Python in our lessons because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- we have to use something for examples\n",
    "- it’s free, well-documented, and runs almost everywhere\n",
    "- it has a large (and growing) user base among scientists\n",
    "- experience shows that it’s easier for novices to pick up than most other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the two most important things are to use whatever language your colleagues are using, so that you can share your work with them easily, and to use that language well.\n"

    "\n",
    "- ‘Start’ → All Programs → Xming → linux\n",
    "\n",
    "navigate to the directory containing the files you downloaded and unzip them using the following commands:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "To get started, go into the data folder from the Unix shell with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "% cd data\n",
    "```\n",
    "We will be using the IPython interpreter for this lesson, on linux.bath.ac.uk this is launched by typing the command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "% ipython3\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note the `3`, this refers to a specific version of Python, changes in its behaviour mean that you will observe different results in certain exercises.  This Python interpreter can be installed on your own computer using this link [install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). This also includes the Jupyter notebook functionality an exciting way of producing reproducible data analysis."
