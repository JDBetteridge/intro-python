Currently we are not in position to deliver an independent build system, but this is certainly under consideration if the dependency stack can be made reasonable.  Rest assured every effort will be made to ensure backwards compatability, however given the limited set of key words currently it is difficult to imagine this not being the case."

Any pull requests should then be made against the relevant development branch (`tutorial_dev` or `build_dev`).  Once accepted these are then merged into the master branch ready to be released for general use.\n",

The process follows the advice on Github for [configuring](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) and [synching a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).  In order to check that updating does not break your current build we recommend the following process, **assuming that `master` is the primary development branch** and that you have followed the instructions for duplicating the repository linked in [episode 2](./02_epsiode.ipynb).
