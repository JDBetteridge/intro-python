    "[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) its umbrella [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) are excellent organisation developing training material in research software skills for academia.  A great deal of effort has been put into the training, particularly from the pedagogical side breaking down each lesson into modular episodes with clear learning objectives, highlighted sections on `Key Points`, `Exericses`, `Solutions` etc.  Additionally all the material is available for general use under a CC BY 4 making it a wonderful resource for the community.  \n",
    "\n",
    "All the courses are written in decorated markdown which is built to generate a lesson website.  We wanted to use a similar design and richness of content, but with a simpler build to reduce dependencies.  Also we wanted to make use of Jupyter Notebooks for the training material due to the ability to mix code and use native mark-up (as far as possible), even though we would not generally intend to use Jupyter for the teaching itself.  By doing so we hoped to deliver a build system that was usable by anyone familar with notebooks and the linux command line, with as little decoration to Markdown as possible"
